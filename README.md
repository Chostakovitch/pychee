# pychee

Client for [Lychee](https://github.com/LycheeOrg/Lychee), written in Python.

Lychee is a photo management system I've been using for years. I had the idea to make a « Lychee filesystem » with [FUSE](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace), so I needed an API client.

My reference is [this documentation](https://lycheeorg.github.io/docs/api.html).

Disclaimer : I usually suck at coding, so use with caution and at your own risks. Tested with Lychee v4.3.4. The code won't be retrocompatible and will just work with the last version.
